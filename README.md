# Sara Al Mehairi's 30MFF Website

Project Name: What's Your Major?

Project Description:

1. GOAL/THEME: "What's Your Major?" is your go-to website for simplifying the process of choosing the perfect major. This website aims to create equip students with a comprehensive overview of available majors and also provides emotional support during this pivotal decision-making phase, because, as mentioned, "Your Are Not Alone!". The website aims to promote a message of hope & union, with a sprinkle of humor in our group video :)
2. COLORS: The website's pastel palette, inspired by the NYUAD's signature color, includes delicate shades of lavender and gentle golden yellows to contrast. These pastel hues are designed to evoke tranquility and provide a sense of relaxation, perfectly suited to ease any worries students may have.
3. NAVIGATION: The website's interface is designed with simplicity in mind. I've gotten rid of unnecessary clutter and focused on what students need most. No extra fluff or distractions.


Process:

"At 'What's Your Major?' my journey to create an empowering and user-friendly website commenced with a deep understanding of the uncertainties that NYUAD students often face when it comes to declaring their majors, especially during their freshman year. To address these concerns, I stepped into the shoes of our users, endeavoring to ensure a seamless and supportive experience throughout their journey. This perspective guided the placement of the 'comedic video' on the main page, aiming to welcome users to a friendly environment and 'turn that frown upside down.' Additionally, I strategically included key points to consider when choosing a major right on the main page. Recognizing the importance of clarity and accessibility, I decided to design a second page dedicated to displaying majors, their respective requirements, and other relevant information. This layout allows users to easily access the details they need without overwhelming them with excessive information like the student portal. Last but not least, I added a "Resources" section to guide students and provide them with necessary contact information...which is usually a struggle to find on nyu's student portal.


Reflection:

Designing the website presented various challenges. Connecting CSS, HTML, and JavaScript files wasn't the easiest task at first, and positioning elements was more challenging than expected. Selecting the right colors was also tough, though I found a a perfect palette with the help of "Coolors." While my initial wireframe was detailed, translating it into a functional website required a lot of skill. Despite these obstacles, I'm proud of my progress as a beginner. The website is a significant achievement, and I'm working on further enhancements and features. I'm particularly proud of how the video effectively tells its meaningful story throughout the website!
